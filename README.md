# Bank Management System


The low-level design of a bank management system project involves delving into the specifics of how various components interact and function within the system. This includes detailing the structure and behavior of individual modules such as customer management, account handling, transaction processing, and administrative functionalities. In this stage, the focus shifts towards the implementation details, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, data structures, and algorithms.

Overall, the low-level design stage lays the groundwork for the actual implementation of the bank management system, providing a blueprint for future development.
Whole project has been built using C++ and object-oriented design principles.
